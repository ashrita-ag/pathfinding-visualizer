Microsoft Codess Engage 2020
See the demo at : https://my-pathfinding-visualizer.netlify.app/

### Introduction
This is a react based web application which help to visualizer several path finding algorithms while finding the the shortest distance between the two given points.
### Meet the Algorithms
This application supports the following algorithms:

```
* AStar Search*
* Best First Search
* Breadth First Search*
* Dijkstra Algorithm*
```
>The algorithms marked with asterisks are guaranteed to find the shortest path.

### Features
* This application makes use of the algorithms mentioned above and tries to find the shortest path.
* The start point and the end point can be selected by user by dragging them to the required positon.
* Obstacles/walls can be set by clicking anywhere in the grid.
